# **About Me**
<br>
Hi, I'm **Adhib**. <br>

<div style="text-align: justify">I found myself gravitating towards geographical information science (GIS) and remote sensing when pursuing a bachelor’s degree in geology and have since been interested in it; hence I’m currently pursuing a master’s degree in GIS at the University of Leicester. 
<br><br>
I like maps - from aesthetic maps that communicate real-world data efficiently, to fantastical video game maps that creatively break conventions. My education in GIS and geology has given me a deep understanding of the intricacies of spatial data and how it can be used to solve real-world problems. Whether working with large datasets or creating interactive maps, I am eager to take on new challenges and find innovative solutions. 
<br><br>
My ability to turn data into meaningful insights makes me an asset to any team, and I am dedicated to using my skills to help any organisation in need of a data-driven approach to problem-solving. I am excited to grow my career in this field while expanding my knowledge and skill set, and I look forward to working with others who share my passion for maps, programming, and geospatial analysis. 
<br><br>
In my free time, I enjoy immersing myself in the world of gaming, tinkering with all kinds of technology, delving into the pages of a good book, and expanding my knowledge of different languages (Japanese at the moment). I am also deeply interested in urban planning and transit systems and spend my time researching, reading and watching documentaries/videos about them. On the weekends, you may find me cycling on local trails and exploring and appreciating nature. I strive to balance my work and studies with my personal passions, and I am constantly seeking new ways to learn and grow while sharing my experiences with others. </div>
