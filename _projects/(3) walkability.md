# Analysing Street Connectivity For Walkability
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Analysing fragmentation and disconnection at a regional level is important to identify urban development that is not inclusive and offer little walkability. Street connectivivty and intersection density can be studied to measure walkability and access to transportation in a city. In this project, this analysis is done for the Japanese city of Kyoto, which is commonly deemed as the most walkable city in Japan. Some of the processing tools utilised for this analysis are Vector Line Intersections, Vector Dissolve, Vector Multipart to Singleparts, Vector Grid Creation, and Vector Spatial Index. </div>
