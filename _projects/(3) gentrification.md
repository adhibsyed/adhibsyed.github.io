# Investigating Gentrification and Housing in Leicester: A Map Portfolio
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify;">This series of maps highlight some aspects related to housing in Leicester, including the possibility of gentrification, income disparity & deprivation, increase in house prices, and the proximity of factors such as crime and healthcare to different areas in Leicester. The maps have been visualised with ArcGIS Pro based on the datasets obtained from a multitude of sources, including the Office for National Statistics, Consumer Data Research Centre, United Kingdom Police Data, and Google Maps. All of the maps are plotted in the British National Grid coordinate system and utilise a scale that provides the most information without compromising on effective visualisation. The maps also consistently utilise the same style of the north arrow and scale bar. In addition to this, only one font, ‘Avenir Next LT Pro’, has been used throughout the portfolio to further improve the cohesiveness of the maps, with different styles of it being used for different aspects of each map. This map portfolio makes use of the ColorBrewer colours to represent spatial information in an accessible manner. </div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The first map in this portfolio is a bivariate choropleth map showing the Lower Super Output Areas (LSOA) in Leicester that could have potentially been gentrified or were undergoing gentrification during the years 2001 to 2011. The two variables visualised in this map are the average house price in 2011 and the projected house price in 2011. The projected house price was calculated based on the inflation rates from 2001 to 2011 provided by the Office for National Statistics. By visualising these variables on the bivariate
map, it was possible to obtain the LSOAs that had a high average house price but low projected
house price, signifying wealthier people moving to those areas and hiking up the average house
price to an unusually high amount. </div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Choropleth maps showcasing the average house prices in 2001 and 2011 are visualised on the second map of the portfolio.</div>

<br>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The third map in this portfolio is a cartogram based on the average weekly income of Middle Super Output Areas (MSOA) in Leicester. Due to the distortion, it becomes easier to pick out which areas have higher or lower income. For a cartogram, a scale bar and north arrow are not taken into consideration because of the distortion. However, a reference map is included to provide supplementary information, such as the actual size of each area and an accurate north arrow. This map provides further insights into the distribution of wealth in Leicester, and it becomes possible to compare this with the maps related to housing and obtain more information.</div>

<br>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The fourth map provides information on the concentration of crime in Leicester during the four quarters of 2011 in the form of small multiple heatmaps. This map attempts to find any correlation between crime and gentrification/wealth distribution in Leicester.</div>
<br>
<img style="border: 0.1px solid grey;" src="/assets/images/p3/p3map4.jpg" alt="Map 4: Crime Distribution">
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The final map in this portfolio plots the index of multiple deprivations sourced from the Consumer Data Research Centre on each Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) in Leicester. Points representing the hospitals in Leicester sourced and digitised from Google Maps provide insights into the proximity of healthcare to the deprived areas in Leicester and highlight which LSOAs are the farthest away from healthcare facilities. When considering the other maps in the portfolio, other inferences can be obtained when linking this data to the housing or wealth distribution maps.</div>
