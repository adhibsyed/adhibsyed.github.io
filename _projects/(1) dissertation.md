<div style="text-align: justify;">This dissertation project presents an application of deep learning and unsupervised learning techniques to model the visual walkability of Leicester based on Google Street View Images. The adapted Integrated Visual Walkability (IVW) framework quantified walkability by extracting perceptual features through semantic segmentation of street-level images using the SegFormer-B5 model. Four visual subindicators were derived: psychological greenery, visual crowdedness, outdoor enclosure, and visual pavement. The IVW index revealed localised variations in walkability, with high scoring streets situated in proximity to lower scoring ones. This reflects the complexity of interactions between fine-grained attributes that distinguish nuanced pedestrian experiences. Insufficient greenery emerged as the subindicator disproportionately limiting overall visual walkability. To uncover additional insights, cluster analysis was applied to identify latent relationships and spatial groupings among the subindicators across the city using the unsupervised K-Means and Fuzzy C-Means algorithms. Incorporating amenity diversity data highlighted correlations between urban vibrancy and greenery levels. However, limitations in accurately distinguishing pavement pixels impacted interpretability of the visual pavement subindicator. Overall, the results demonstrate the potential of computer vision and unsupervised learning techniques to advance walkability modelling through multidimensional assessment.</div>
